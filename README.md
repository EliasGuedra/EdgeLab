# EdgeLab public codebase

This repo collect public code and scripts developed to be used in the [EdgeLab](https://www.ai.se/en/data-factory/edge-lab) at [AI Sweden](https://www.ai.se/en). 

Although specifically tailored for the EdgeLab elements could perhaps be of general interest.

## Notes

### Coding style
We try to maintain a uniform look of the code following guidelines from [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), see also [How to Write Beautiful Python Code With PEP 8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/).

We also urge contributors to use function annotations as defined in [PEP-3107](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/).
